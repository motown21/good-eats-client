## Deployment


## About



## Structure


### Included Routes

This template comes with a handful of front-end routes that display
different components for user actions.

| Endpoint         | Component | `AuthenticatedRoute`? |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `/sign-up`       | `SignUp`    | No |
| `/sign-in`       | `SignIn`    | No |
| `/change-password` | `ChangePassword`  | Yes |
| `/sign-out`        | `SignOut`   | Yes |

There is no HTTP verb listed because these are all front-end routes handled by
React. Some of these routes should not be available unless a user is signed in,
so they will use the `AuthenticatedRoute` component instead of the regular
`Route`. This custom component is provided as part of the template, and is not
a part of the React library (see more below).

## Features

### Bootstrap

This template includes two different implementations of the classic Bootstrap
library we know and love.

#### `bootstrap`

The first implementation of Bootstrap comes from the `bootstrap` npm package,
and provides all of the normal Bootstrap classes and styling we were able to
use with the `browser-template`. This package is included in the
`src/index.scss` file at the very top of the file. That means JSX in this
template can utilize Bootstrap classes like `btn`, `container`, `row`, etc.

See an example below:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const AboutPage = () => (
  <div className="card">
    <div className="card-body">
      <h1 className="card-title">About Page</h1>
      <p className="card-text">There is a Bootstrap card on this page!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)

export default AboutPage
```

> Note: Remember to use `className` not `class` in your JSX!

#### `react-bootstrap`

In addition to the classic Bootstrap classes we can plug into our JSX, this
template also comes with a special package called [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
This package allows us to use special React components that have been pre-built
according to the Bootstrap library.

Import components from the `react-bootstrap` library, then use them just like
regular components in your JSX!

See an example below:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card'

const AboutPage = () => (
  <Card>
    <Card.Body>
      <Card.Title>The About Page</Card.Title>
      <Card.Text>There is a Bootstrap card on this page!</Card.Text>
    </Card.Body>
  </Card>
)

export default AboutPage
```

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `npm run nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code and complains.
- `npm run make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard
  Style.
- `npm run start`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads.
- `npm run build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
- `npm run deploy`: builds and deploys main branch
